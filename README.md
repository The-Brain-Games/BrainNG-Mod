# BrainNG-Mod

**Disclaimer:** This mod was origonaly developed by Uncle Joey as a program named "Uncle Joey's Base" for 2Fast BeamMP servers.

Uncle Joey's Base provides some essential client-side addons for your BeamMP server, including:
- A message of the day with BBCode support (motd)
- Player restrictions (limiting rewinds, menu options etc.)
- Limiting resets to a certain amount per time
- Day / night time syncing
- Environment (weather) syncing (rain (snow), wind, clouds, fog and gravity)

### Motd BBCodes
You can use BBCodes in your motd, `config.lua` contains a sample.
`[url] [forumurl] [ico] [h1] [h2] [h3] [h4] [h5] [h6] [img] [action] [list] [olist] [strike] [code] [br] [MEDIA=youtube] [size] [color] [hr] [spoiler] [font] [left] [center] [right] [i] [b] [u] [s]`
> Note: external urls are not allowed by BeamNG and will not work, only local links and links to beamng.com are allowed.

Variables:
* `{serverTime}` prints the current server time (as set in the config)
